In 'sweep' of 'environment-settings', 'driftScale' specifies the scale of the drift with respect to the state range; 'sensorLife' specifies the number of time-steps after which the probability of drift will become nearly 1; 'driftProb' is the probability scale, if it's less than 0, drift occurs with prob=1, if it's between 0 and 1, the max prob is scaled by this value.",
