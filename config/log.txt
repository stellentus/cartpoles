V1:
Change hyperparameter set

V2:

Add inner loop when running calibration model. Given 1 dataset, repeat with different random seeds.
Add  ``"total-logs": 10` in both agent and environment settings, to define the total number of outer loop

Random restart: send 2 dataset into knn model, one with random restart, for generating k-nearest neighbor; one without random restart, for generating true start state in model

V3:

Random restart: change from state random restart to state-action random restart. Take random action at the 1st step of each episode for data collection.

V4:
Collect data with not fully learned policy, with a larger gamma=0.99858261302

V5:
KNN model uses distance between representations rather than between environment states.

V6.9:
FQI with larger data set

V7:
FQI with changed validation: use learning net & .Precition() to calculate error, with early learning
